#NFL Team Performance Analysis: Home vs. Away Games

## Overview
In this project, I applied data wrangling, analysis, and visualization skills to explore how NFL team performance varies when playing at home versus away. Using two datasets containing NFL game statistics from the 2021 season, I aimed to answer the following research questions:

* How does total yards for each team vary when playing at home vs. playing as an away team?
* How does points per game for each team vary when playing at home vs. playing as an away team?

The analysis involved retrieving, cleaning, and merging the datasets, assessing them for data quality and structure issues, and performing a combination of statistical analysis and visualizations to answer these questions.

## Data Description
The project uses two datasets containing NFL game data for the 2021 season:
* Dataset 1: Contains information on total yards, points scored, and points allowed for each team.
* Dataset 2: Provides additional context such as game location (home/away) and specific details related to team performance.

## Analysis and Visualization
The cleaned and merged data were analyzed to answer the research questions using both visual and statistical methods:

1. **How does total yards for each team vary when playing at home vs. playing as an away team?**

The analysis shows that league-wide, there is no significant difference in total yards gained when playing at home versus away. The average difference is approximately 8 yards. The distribution follows a bell curve, with most teams falling within ±100 yards of this difference. However, outliers like the Cincinnati Bengals and New York Jets suggest potential areas for deeper analysis, such as weather conditions, player injuries, or the strength of the opponent.

2. **How does points per game for each team vary when playing at home vs. playing as an away team?**

Answer: Similar to the total yards analysis, there is little difference in average points scored at home versus away. On average, teams score about 24 points at home and 22 points away — a difference of just 2 points. This aligns with betting practices where the home team is typically given a 3-point advantage. However, notable exceptions exist, such as the Dallas Cowboys scoring 10 points more at home, suggesting possible reasons for further investigation (e.g., weather conditions or home-field advantage).

## Reflection
If I had more time, I would extend this analysis to include multiple seasons to identify trends over time. Additionally, I would explore team performance in the first half versus the second half of the season to examine any potential correlations with making the playoffs or achieving a winning record. Given the frequent occurrence of player injuries, year-over-year performance variations could also provide valuable insights.

## Key Findings
* Total Yards: On average, NFL teams do not show a significant difference in total yards gained when playing at home versus away.
* Points per Game: Teams score similarly at home and away, with some exceptions. These exceptions could provide further areas of analysis, such as the impact of weather or the psychological effects of home-field advantage.
* Outliers: Certain teams, like the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills, exhibit significant differences in performance when playing at home versus away, pointing to potential underlying factors worth exploring.

## Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while the overall league trends show minimal differences in team performance between home and away games, individual teams may have unique characteristics or circumstances that impact their performance. Understanding these nuances can provide valuable insights for analysts, bettors, and fans alike.

## Future Work
Extend the analysis to cover multiple seasons to observe long-term trends.
Investigate additional factors that could affect team performance, such as weather conditions, player injuries, and coaching strategies.
Explore performance differences between the first and second halves of the season and their potential impact on playoff qualification.
